									<p>This was a simple project that I wanted to make so that I could mount my Joy-Cons on my phone (or vice-versa). There are grips available 
                  that attach to controllers and allow the mounting of a phone. Some Joy-Con grips also exist. But I wanted to use a phone grip that I already 
                  had, which used the same type of screw as camera hardware, and I wanted to make it using 3D printing. Additionally, I wanted it to be compatible 
                  with the same type of hardware as the camera accessory hardware. I also had a mini fill light that is used with cameras, which came with a suction 
                  cup grip to mount to a laptop is a webcam lamp, but these accessories were also compatible with the same system as the phone grip. Thus, creating 
                  something that was compatible with this modular environment could open up a lot of possibilities, and it excited me. Additionally, instead of having 
                  seperate items to perform seperate tasks, trying to be creative and attempting these tasks with resources that I already have available or were less 
                  wasteful was another achievement I wanted to accomplish with this design. </p>

									<p>Using the resources I had, and my friend's 3D printer, I was able to create a working version of the design that was compatible with a simple Joy-Con 
                  grip. It can "interface" with the hardware I mentioned earlier, allowing for the grip to act as a phone stand with the controllers still accessible. 
                  Additionally, it can be used on a tripod. While it may seem like using the controllers is only possible with the Nintendo Switch, or only for games, 
                  using a remapping software will allow for different functions to be assigned to the buttons, joystick, triggers, and other inputs of the controller. I 
                  have used a remapping software to convert one of my Joy-Cons into a mouse. Similarly, the Joy-Con can work as a presentation remote, a camera remote for 
                  a phone, or may have other use cases. For my case, I typically use my phone as another monitor for my laptop. Using this grip-stand combo gives the phone 
                  some elevation, making it easier to see. The Joy-Cons can charge on the grip if they are low on charge, but can still be used while charging.</p>
									
									<p>Ramblings aside, the files for printing the grip phone mount are in the link above. Make sure you have a slimmer grip (the normal Joy-Con grip will 
                  NOT work with this design). Feel free to leave suggestions.</p>
