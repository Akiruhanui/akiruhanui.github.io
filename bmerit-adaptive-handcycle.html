										<h2>Neuro-rehab for upper extremities.</h2>

									<p>The focus of this club project was to create an adaptable and inclusive therapy for individuals in neuro rehabilitation
									to improve their upper extremity mobility and cardiovascular endurance. This system was to mount a bike trainer onto a frame 
									that could adjust the trainer to fit the user’s height. The bike trainer was to be used as the main handcycle system. The 
									nine person mechanical team in BMERIT (Biomedical Engineering Research and Innovation Team) was separated into three subteams 
									(each with three members): Frame, Lifting, and Mounting.</p>

									<p>The Frame subteam was tasked with designing the overarching structure that would allow for the attachment of the other 
									subteams’ components and handcycle, while being easy to assemble and easy for the patient to maneuver in. The Lifting subteam 
									focused on designing a method of moving the bike trainer to adjust to a variety of users, which would be able to hold the weight 
									of the remaining hanging components. The Mounting subteam created methods to mount the bike trainer to a plate, which would then 
									mount onto the Frame and Lifting assembly. This included designing clamps to hold the bike trainer in place.</p>

										<br><p>Ideation</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>This project was the very first club project that I worked on. When i joined the club, I was assigned to the frame
									subteam. I joined at a time when designs were being revised and ideation for a new frame was in progress. I suggested
									using a shared Onenote notebook to allow for more collaborative sketching and drawing. This Onenote notebook acted like
									a Google Docs document, but for sketching. It allowed for everyone to be able to sketch collectively, and see each other's
									contributions in almost real-time. The Onenote document did increase the pace of ideation, and made it easier to share
									ideas as a team.</p>

									<p>The following sketch was a concept design to allow the frame to have removable castors. The design of these castor plates 
									was based off of a YouTube video where the uploader created castor plates for a workbench. Rough ideas for the dimensions were 
									obtained based on pictures and the initial frame design, and they were used to create the rough sketches of the castor plates. 
									This rough sketch was then used to model the castor plates. However, after safety considerations and a discussion with our sponsor, 
									it was decided that the plates would be unsafe and difficult to use. Instead, it was decided to use a combination of castor wheels 
									with leveling feet to allow for the frame to be stabilized when it was in use.</p>

									<p>The CAD design was created when the CAD model of the frame was created. The main idea for the frame was to use aluminum t-slot 
									extrusions, as they had simple to use hardware while being lightweight and strong. This kept the design easy to assemble, easy to 
									upgrade, and easy to order replacement components for. A general design was in mind, so an initial CAD model was created.</p>
