										<h2>Neuro-rehab for upper extremities.</h2>
										<p>My role: Mechanical Team Member</p>
									</header>

									<p>The focus of this club project was to create an adaptable and inclusive therapy for individuals in neuro rehabilitation
									to improve their upper extremity mobility and cardiovascular endurance. This system mounts a bike trainer onto a frame 
									that could adjust the trainer to fit the user’s height. The nine person mechanical team in BMERIT (Biomedical Engineering 
									Research and Innovation Team) was separated into three subteams: Frame, Lifting, and Mounting.</p>

									<p>The Frame subteam was tasked with designing the overarching structure that would allow for the attachment of the other 
									subteams’ components and handcycle, while being easy to assemble and easy for the patient to maneuver in. The Lifting subteam 
									focused on designing a method of moving the bike trainer to adjust to a variety of users, which would be able to hold the weight 
									of the remaining hanging components. The Mounting subteam created methods to mount the bike trainer onto the Frame and Lifting 
									assembly.</p>

										<br><p>Ideation</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>This project was the very first club project that I worked on. When I joined the club, I was assigned to the Frame
									subteam. I joined at a time when designs were being revised and ideation for a new frame was in progress. I suggested
									using a shared Onenote notebook to allow for more collaborative sketching and drawing. This Onenote notebook acted like
									a Google Docs document, but for sketching. It allowed for everyone to be able to sketch collectively, and see each other's
									contributions in almost real-time. The Onenote document did increase the pace of ideation, and made it easier to share
									ideas as a team.</p>

									<p>The following sketch was a concept design to allow the frame to have removable castors. The design of these castor plates 
									was based off of a YouTube video where the uploader created castor plates for a workbench. Rough ideas for the dimensions were 
									obtained based on pictures and the initial frame design, and they were used to create the rough sketches of the castor plates. 
									This rough sketch was then used to model the castor plates. However, after safety considerations and a discussion with our sponsor, 
									it was decided that the plates would be unsafe and difficult to use. Instead, it was decided to use a combination of castor wheels 
									with leveling feet to allow for the frame to be stabilized when it was in use.</p>

									</header>

									<a href="#" class="image featured">
										<img src="images/Adaptive_Handcycle_Pictures/Handcycle_Initial_Frame_CAD_FEA.png" alt="" />
									</a>

									<p>The CAD design of the frame was made using the sketches and the previous CAD model. Then, SolidWorks's built in FEA (Finite-Element analysis) 
									was used to check the structural integrity of the frame under the required loading. The bottom of the frame was kept fix while a load was applied 
									at the top of the frame.</p>

									<p>While creating the asssembly and running the FEA simulation, I ran into an error. I'm not sure why, maybe it's because of how little information 
									the warning window provides, but I found this SolidWorks error to be pretty funny.</p>

									</a>

									<p>It just casually says "Catastrophic failure", and that's it. Nothing more. Anyways, getting back on track...</p>

									<p>As some forms of testing could not be performed via simulations (such as vibrational testing, shaking the frame, tipping, etc.), the team decided 
									on creating a physical prototype. The parts were ordered and transported to the workspace to be assembled.
									</p>

										<p>Building the Frame</p>
									</header>

									<p>Once the parts were ordered and transported, the frame was assembled in its initial configuration. However, the design had a tipping issue (where the 
									intersection of the beams acted as the pivot point), so the vertical beams were rearranged to mitigate tipping.</p><br>

									<a href="#" class="image featured">
										<img src="images/Adaptive_Handcycle_Pictures/Handcycle_Irl_Assembly.png" alt="" />
									</a>

									<p>Informal testing was done on just the frame, which invovled shaking the frame lightly and applying a 70 kg load onto the top beam. These informal tests 
									were quick verifications of the stability of the design, and to ensure that it was able to hold its intended load.</p>

										<p>Revisiting CAD and Machining</p>
									</header>

									<p>Due to some minor changes in the design, and the need for an updated model, a teammate and I remade the design using the lastest version of the part 
									models. To ensure the design was able to showcase its mobility easily, the model was split into two seperate assemblies. These assemblies were then saved 
									as individual parts, then brought together into a final assembly. This method allowed the files to not be too large or result in issues with simulating 
									movement. This model also included a scan of the cycling apparatus. [Include link to video if allowed?].</p>

									</a>

									<p>Some components of the design made by the Lifting and Mounting sub-teams were created in-house. These components required machining processes including 
									waterjet cutting and milling. I was given the opportunity to assist these sub-teams with machining.</p>
